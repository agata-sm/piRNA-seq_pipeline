# piRNA-seq_pipeline
A pipeline for processing sRNA-seq data tailored for piRNA discovery and annotation

Full version of the pipeline will execute all processing steps and can be used for *de novo* detection of piRNA clusters. 
Minimal version of the pipeline will skip the piRNA cluster detection and instead summarise reads mapped to coordinates of piRNA clusters 
provided in a `gtf` annotation file.
